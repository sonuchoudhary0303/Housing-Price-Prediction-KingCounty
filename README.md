# Housing-Price-Prediction-KingCounty

This project analyzes housing data from King County, USA, to build machine learning models that predict house sale prices based on features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, waterfront view, and more. The dataset includes over 21,000 house sales, and the analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and modeling with linear and polynomial regression, as well as ridge regression. The best model achieved an RÂ² score of around 0.70, indicating strong predictive performance. Key features used include floors, waterfront, latitude, bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage variables, grade, and view. The project code is contained in a Jupyter notebook, which can be run after installing necessary Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib. This repository also includes required screenshots and documentation for project submission.
